1.Implement an extension method Substring(int index, int length) for the class StringBuilder that returns new StringBuilder and has the same functionality as Substring in the class String.
2.Implement a set of extension methods for IEnumerable<T> that implement the following group functions: sum, product, min, max, average.
3.Write a method that from a given array of students finds all students whose first name is before its last name alphabetically. Use LINQ query operators.
4.Write a LINQ query that finds the first name and last name of all students with age between 18 and 24.
5.Using the extension methods OrderBy() and ThenBy() with lambda expressions sort the students by first name and last name in descending order. Rewrite the same with LINQ.
6.Write a program that prints from given array of integers all numbers that are divisible by 7 and 3. Use the built-in extension methods and lambda expressions. Rewrite the same with LINQ.
7.Using delegates write a class Timer that has can execute certain method at each t seconds.
8*. Read in MSDN about the keyword event in C# and how to publish events. Re-implement the above using .NET events and following the best practices.
