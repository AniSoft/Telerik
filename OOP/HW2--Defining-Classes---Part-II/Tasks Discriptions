1.Create a structure Point3D to hold a 3D-coordinate {X, Y, Z} in the Euclidian 3D space. Implement the ToString() to enable printing a 3D point.
2.Add a private static read-only field to hold the start of the coordinate system Â– the point O{0, 0, 0}. Add a static property to return the point O.
3.Write a static class with a static method to calculate the distance between two points in the 3D space.
4.Create a class Path to hold a sequence of points in the 3D space. Create a static class PathStorage with static methods to save and load paths from a text file. Use a file format of your choice.
5.Write a generic class GenericList that keeps a list of elements of some parametric type T. Keep the elements of the list in an array with fixed capacity which is given as parameter in the class constructor. Implement methods for adding element, accessing element by index, removing element by index, inserting element at given position, clearing the list, finding element by its value and ToString(). Check all input parameters to avoid accessing elements at invalid positions.
6.Implement auto-grow functionality: when the internal array is full, create a new array of double size and move all elements to it.
7.Create generic methods Min() and Max() for finding the minimal and maximal element in the GenericList. You may need to add a generic constraints for the type T.
8.Define a class Matrix to hold a matrix of numbers (e.g. integers, floats, decimals).
9.Implement an indexer this[row, col] to access the inner matrix cells.
10.Implement the operators + and - (addition and subtraction of matrices of the same size) and * for matrix multiplication. Throw an exception when the operation cannot be performed. Implement the true operator (check for non-zero elements).
11.Create a [Version] attribute that can be applied to structures, classes, interfaces, enumerations and methods and holds a version in the format major.minor (e.g. 2.11). Apply the version attribute to a sample class and display its version at runtime.
